I have loved technology and all the intresting things you can do with it all my life - but never realised how easy it was to learn to code and get involved with building and maintaining projects. I have a huge desire to learn from experienced tech businesses, with my key goal of using my skills to make a diffrence for people and to increase accessibility. I have been learning though <a href="https://www.shecodes.io">SheCodes</a> and teaching myself. I have completed two certifications with SheCodes - SheCodes Basics and SheCodes Plus.
